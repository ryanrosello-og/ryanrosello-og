### üëã Hello Friends

I work for the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), where I make production grade test automation code in order to test software.  It has been an exciting journey to watch the evolution of the test automation field having worked in this area for over 15 years.


### üí°Here are some of my open source projects:

* [Playwright Slack Reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-slack-report) - Publish your Playwright test results to your favorite Slack channel(s)
  
* [Playwright Trace Redactor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-redactor) - This is a tool that can be used to redact sensitive information from your Playwright trace files.

* [Cypress harvester](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-harvester) - A plug-in for Cypress allowing you to easliy work with html elements and repeating elements, whether it be for test assertions or for web scarping purposes

* [pict-pairwise-testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pict-pairwise-testing) - A simple Nodejs wrapper for PICT, this brings the goodness of pairwise (aka all pairs) testing into the Javascript world

* [Playwright Trace Viewer for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanrosello-og.playwright-vscode-trace-viewer) - Provides an ability to open one or more Trace files generated by Playwright tests directly from Visual Studio Code
